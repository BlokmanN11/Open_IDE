Welcome to the project, open IDE. This will be an open source IDE (integrated development environement). All contributions are welcome,
however i have not added contribution guidelines yet. I would like to keep everything in python, becouse i find it's a very fun language
to use. 

I hope you enjoy this project and we can help much people with an IDE.
